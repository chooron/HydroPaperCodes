The highlights of the paper state that K50 is validated across 569 CAMELS basins, but in the results section, only three basins from the CAMELS sites are used for the case studies. This seems like a small sample size, as any collection of other basins could be used and potentially give a different result. Is there a reason you did not do a more comprehensive study? Potentially looking at all gauges within a region rather than a single point? Given the small sample size, I have a tough time believing the conclusions of increased interpretability.
